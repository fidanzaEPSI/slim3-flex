# Slim 3 Flex

A Slim 3 starter structure inspired from Laravel.

The architecture is about using phpleague's Container package rather than the original Container of Slim. That way, it offers a tidy and clean way to import additionnal bricks/features for your next Slim webapp or rest API

## Features

- Data access using Laravel's **Eloquent ORM**
- Rendering views and paginating with **Twig**. Also supports sharing services globally across views.
- **Basics of authentication workflow** : user registration, login, logout, remember me, authorizations for routes through middlewares.
- **Services and dependencies** loaded using Providers, allows autoloading exposed classnames/aliases from inside other classes.
- Separated, **easy to setup app configuration** files inside config/ folder
- Seeds and migrations using **Phinx**
- Email sending using **Swiftmailer**
- A logger service using **Monolog**

Various already implemented features : form validation, password hashing, session storage, csrf protection, ...

## Upcoming

- Events and listeners
- Filesystem service
- Facades
- Console commands

### Run commands
